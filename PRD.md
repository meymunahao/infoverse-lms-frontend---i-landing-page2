Product Requirements Document: Frontend v2.0 (UI & Experience)Date: December 16, 2025Status: DraftPriority: Critical (January Launch)1. Executive SummaryThe frontend interface requires updates to support the new business model (school licensing), marketing efforts (blogs/nurtured pages), and value-added features (AI Tutor). The application remains hosted on Netlify but must be re-configured to consume endpoints from the new Google Cloud Backend.2. User Interface Changes2.1 Authentication (B2B Support)Page: src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsxRequirement: Add a "Register with School Code" toggle or tab.UI Logic:Standard: Name, Email, Password.School: Name, Email, Password, License Code.Behavior: If License Code is valid (checked against backend), skip the "Payment/Pricing" onboarding steps and redirect directly to Dashboard.2.2 AI Tutor ("Ask AI")Page: src/app/lessons/[slug]/page.tsxFeature: A floating action button (FAB) or Sidebar Tab labeled "AI Helper" (incorporating Gemini).Interaction:User clicks "AI Helper".Chat interface opens (slide-over or modal).User types: "Explain this concept simply."Frontend sends current lesson context + user query to /api/v1/ai/explain.Display streaming or static response from Gemini.Visuals: Use Google Gemini brand colors (blue/purple gradients) to highlight this feature as premium/high-tech.2.3 Marketing Content PagesBlog Listing:Route: /blog/page.tsxUI: Grid of cards fetching from /api/v1/posts?type=BLOG. Each card shows Image, Title, Excerpt, Date.Blog Post:Route: /blog/[slug]/page.tsxUI: Clean, readable typography for long-form content."Nurtured" Page:Route: /nurtured/page.tsxUI: specific landing page design (requirements to be clarified by boss, but assume standard CMS content fetching with type NURTURED).2.4 Navigation & Menu UpdatesGeography Removal:Ensure the Subjects listing page (src/app/subjects/page.tsx) does not render the Geography card.This should be handled automatically if the API filters it, but add a frontend filter as a fallback: .filter(subject => subject.slug !== 'geography').Footer: Add links to "Blog" and "Schools" (Nurtured/Licensing info).3. Technical Implementation3.1 Environment ConfigFile: next.config.ts & Netlify Environment VariablesAction: Update NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to point to the new Google Cloud Run backend URL (e.g., https://infoverse-backend-xyz-uc.a.run.app).CORS: Ensure the backend specifically whitelists the Netlify domain (e.g., https://infoverse-ed.netlify.app).3.2 Data FetchingLibrary: Continue using SWR/Axios.New Hook: useAI hook to handle the loading states of Gemini requests.New Hook: useContent hook to fetch blog posts.4. Design System (Tailwind v4)Consistency: Ensure new Blog and AI components utilize the existing src/components/ui/ primitives (Card, Button, Input) to maintain brand consistency.Responsive: All new pages (Blog, AI Modal) must be fully mobile-responsive.5. DeploymentTarget: Netlify (Unchanged).Action: Trigger a redeploy on Netlify once the Backend URL variable is updated.
